**The easiest part of Rails**
       I found that the easiest part of my rails project was writing the code. I mean, you come across many errors along the way from beginning to end. It reminds me mush like life as in making mistakes and corecting them a majority of our lives.
			 
**The worst part of Rails**
     I found the most difficult part for me to work was flash messages. It isn't as hard as I made it to be in my head.
		 
**My process of working on my project**
    I started with creating a new Rails app by running `rails new` in the terminal. I then followed by sitting down and figuring how I wanted my project to look with models, controllers, views, and schema. My next step was to run `rails g resource` with all my database names and columns that I wanted to included.
		After that, it was time to run rails migration, Next was all the model validations and relations. Followed by, working on each controller, route, and views individually one by one following all the errors.
