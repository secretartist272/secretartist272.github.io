     One of the most interesting problems that I came across in learning Procedural Ruby was when it cam to the hashes and arrays. Even though they were easy to learn putting them into affect together in the same solution to a problem. I was getting the signs for each mixed when in the same problem, but alone I had an easy time figuring it out. So the solution I came up with to keep myself from continuing to mix them up with was to write them and other symbols that I kept getting confused with. This is the way that worked for me. I no longer get them mixed up.
