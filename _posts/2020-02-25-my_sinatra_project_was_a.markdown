### My sinatra Project was a nightmare to work on!
I had so many issues that happened during this project that made it hard to focus solely on this project. I can say though it was fun. 

### **The idea of my Project:** 
The idea of my project was based solely on two hobbies of mine( The love of reading poetry and the love of writing it). I wanted to create a place where Users could read poetry and create/edit only their own poetry. This task alone seems like such an easy one.  Oh boy was I so wrong.

### **The Process that came from an idea:** 
My first part of the process of creating this idea was to map out what controllers, modes, and views (along with my databases) that I was going to need.

 #### Plans:
 
A **user** would need a *username, name, age*, and *password*. (it also *has_many poems*). Their passwords would need to be hidden and encrypted in the database.
 
 A **poem** would need a *title, content*, and *user_id*. (as it *belongs_to* a certain author) This is where CRUD would take place!

#### Steps In completing Project:
1.  I used gem corneal to create my project.
2.  I opened my project in VScode
3.  Created my db migrate files for users table and poems table.
4.  Once finished, I ran 'rake db:migrate'
5.  I created my user model and poem model.
6.  I started with my main page after running shotgun in my terminal.
7.   starting going between my controllers and views. 

#### Final Thoughts: 

I love my project, but it was the hardest to work on. Not as in the code, but everything thing happening around me at the time.
