       My name is Jacqueline Freeland, but I go by Jax. I have many reasons for why I made my choice and decided to learn Software Engineering.  I have five main 'variables = "reasons" ' that gave me my reasons to look into looking for something better to do with my life that I enjoy. I enjoy anything computer related.
			 
			 My biggest reason starts with my kids(5). They are my biggest cheer squad I have.  The main reason that they have given me my reasons for learning software engineering are many, but the main reason is that I have seen my oldest three girls Aurora, Amnisty, and Kaya being able to play games with ease on my phone or my computer (like prodigy and minecraft, "School programs"). I would try to let my youngest of my four daughters Jaimi play but she struggled in the sense of not being able to concentrate and focus on the game itself. (She has severe ADHD with displacement sensitivity, meaning "her memory bank (aka brain) doesn't allow her to comprehend due to to much overload). Then came my son, "William", he  was diagnosed with being on the Autism Spectrum and struggles with a lot. (The two biggest are his speech and his "Hand-eye" cordination.) My main prupose in life as their mother is to help them grow and learn as they become adults. I want to be able to make a integrated system that will allow for them to both learn and help stay on a schedule, but they are my main reason for wanting to learn software engineering. 
			 
			 My second biggest reason for learning Software engineering is because my whole life I have loved technology. The first thirty years of my life has been focused on learning the ins-and-outs of computer components and phone components (Mostly Android phones, PC and MAC laptops.). I provided a living doing this, so that I could be home with my children. I know that if I further my education with Software Engineering, that I can further my profit to create a better home for my children.
			 
			 My third biggest reason for learning Software Engineering is that it isn't just for me to learn. My children are always asking questions about what kind of this a Software Engineer can do in life. My oldest daughter, Aurora, wants to learn Software engineering too. It is because of this that made me want to learn Software Engineering more.
